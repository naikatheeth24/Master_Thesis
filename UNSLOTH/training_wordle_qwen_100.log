You are playing Wordle, a word-guessing game.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM → Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE → Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK → Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step by step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Let me solve this step by step.
<think>
--------------------
Response:
From the first guess "CRANE", we know:
- C, R, and e are not in the word.
- N is is not in the correct position, but it isn't fully excluded either.

From the second guess "INPUT", we know:
- I, N, U, and T are not in the word.
- P is is correct but not in its position.

We know the secret word cannot contain the letters C, I, N, R, P, U, or T. This leaves us with the letters A, E, and their positions must be considered in subsequent guesses.

The secret word could contain A, E, or other letters. However, we can deduce:
- A is cannot be the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th letter.
 - E cannot be the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th letter.
 - A cannot be the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th letter due to previous inputs.

Let first possible letters we have left, could be any mix, considering the exclusions. Let's try a common 5-letter word that still excludes these.

   - R(✓) means R is in the word and in the correct position
   - A(x) means A is not in the word
   - N(✓) means N is in the word and in the correct position
   - E(✓) means E is in the word and in the correct position

2. From Guess 2 (BRINE):
   - B(x) means B is not in the word
   - r(✓) means r is in the word but not in the correct position (it’s already in the secondnd position from the CRAIN feedback)
   - I(x) means I is not in the word
   - N(✓) means N is in the word and in the correct position (consistent with CRane)
   - E(✓) means E is in the word and in the correct position

Combining these two pieces of information:
- The word must contain r, n, and e.
- It must not contain c, b, a, i.

3. Let's make an educated guess considering above rules and try for a new word that satisfies these constraints.

A plausible 5-letter word could be: "RaNne".

 - There's one more letter in the word, not guessed yet

Let letter "R" is known, but just not in correct position. It might be in the word but not in these positions.

 I must run all possible words that are left after the known correct and incorrect letters.

Let considering words remaining to guess, must contain B, A, N and one unknown, but not C, J, R, O, and E. Let's try letters like S, D, L, P, etc. first. </think>

Based on the feedback from both guesses, A, B, O, U, and T are all out, and C and R are also out. Let's try to come with a new combination that fits all conditions:
- Contains no A, B, C, O, U, T
 - R and N are not in the word

Based on this information, the word must contain r, a, and a, but these letters should be in their positions and the presence of no other repeated letters.

Response:
From the feedback:
1. CRANE:

   - R is not in the word
   - A is not in the word
   - N is not in the word
   - E is not in the word

2. RELIC:
   - R is in the word (position 2)
   - E is in the word (position 1, but we already knew this from Cranene)
   - L is not in the word
   - I is not in the word
   - C is is not in the word

Based on these, I can infer:
- The letter 'r' is in the second position.
 - The letter 'e' is in the first position.
 - Neither 'l', 'i' nor 'c' are in the word.
 - 'n' and 'a' from Craneen are also not in the word, and 'c' isn't, so we're a bit clearer on letters.

I'll prioritize finding a word that fits when we already know what isn't present.

<think>
--------------------
Response:
For Guess 1: CRANE, the feedback indicates:
- C is not in the word
 - R is not in the word
 - A is not in the right position, but may be in the word 
 - N is not in the word
 - E is not in the word

For Guess 2: SWEAT, the feedback indicates:
 - S is in the word, in the first position
 - W is in the word, but in the second position
 - E is not in the word
 - A is not in the word
 - T is in the word, in the last position

Given these letters and feedback, the word likely needs the pattern S _ W _ T, with the middle letter being one from the letters A, E, R, which didn't appear in previous guesses and are not repeated.

Guess 2: PEARL -> Feedback: P(x) E(✓) A(✓) R(✓) L(x)<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let me solve this step by step.
<think>
--------------------
Response:
From the feedback:
1. For the first guess (CRANE):
   - C(x) → C is not in the word
   - R(-) → R could be in the correct position or wrong position
   - A(✓) → A is in the word, but not in position 3
   - N(x) → N is not in the word
   - E(-) → E is not in the word
   
2. For the second guess (PEARL):
   - P(x) → P is not in the word
   - E(✓) → E is in the word, and correctly positioned in position 2
   - A(✓) → A is in the word and correctly positioned in position 4
   - R(✓) → R is in the word and correctly positioned in position 3
   - L(x) → L is not in the word

From this, we have:
- C and P cannot be in the word.
- A, E, R, and L have positions: A at 4, E at 2, r at 3, L not in the word.
- There must be a 5th letter that is not mentioned yet, none of the letters in the guesses repeated in their correct positions.

Let letters in word but not correct position:
 - B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (any of these could potentially fit)

Based on these constraints, let’s make a new guess.

From the first guess (CRANE):

- R is in the secret word, but not in the 2nd position.
- A is NOT in the secret word.
 -N is NOT in the secret word.
 -E is NOT in the secret word.

 -e is is in secret word, but in correct position 1.
 -m the secret word does not have m.
 - i the secret word does not have i.
 -t the secret word does not have t.

Knowing that 'r' and 'e' are part of the correct word, I can incorporate these into my next guess. Let's avoid positions that we already know are correct or incorrect. 

Let guess a new 5-letter word that includes 'r' in the 2nd position and 'e' in the 1st position, while also trying to avoid duplicating any letters or using any already eliminated letters (A, C, I, M, N, T, E in the wrong positions, and C, N, T, E in any position).

   - Y is not in the word.

3. So the letters we know for sure are not in the word are: r, o, c, k, e , y.
4. Now, let's try to fit the remaining letters into a new 5-letter word. Since A and N are not in their correct positions from the first guess, they could be anywhere except in the positions they were in (4th for N, and 3rd for A).
5. Let's try a word that has A and N in it, as these are the only remaining possible letters from the first guess results.

 - O is not in the word
 - U is not in the word
 - S is in the word but in the wrong position
 - E is in position 5

Since E is in position 5 is given in both guesses, the secret word must end with 'E'. The only letter we have any certainty about from the previous information is S which is is in the word, but we need to place it somewhere besides position 5.

Let consider words combinations that fit these criteria and check feasibility.

I will make my next guess considering the letters we know are not in the word and which position we know 'E' should be in.

Let my guess will be:

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM → Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE → Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK → Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step by step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Response:
- From the first guess (CRANE) and feedback, we know: R is correct and in the correct position, E is correct but in the wrong position, and C, A, N are not in the word at all.
- From the second guess (PRIME) and feedback, we know P and I are correct and in the correct positions, M is correct but in the wrong position, and E is correct but in the correct position.
- Integrating both, we know R and i are in the 2nd and 3rd positions respectively, and we have the letters p, r, i, m, e to fit into the correct positions for the word.
 - Since e cannot be the last letter (Guessed in CRane and prime already), the possible arrangements closely matching PRIME or includes letters should be sliding.
 - Testing PRISM, we see R and i are correct, p and m are correct but in the wrong places, and s and m might fit, but e should be not in last.
 - Testing PRISM, it fits all perfect as it has r and i in 2 and 3 positions, p and m not in correct places, e out of all given.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous feedback:
Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(-) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: FRECK -> Feedback: F(x) R(✓) E(✓) C(✓) K(✓)<|im_end|>

Let me solve this step by step.
<think>
--------------------
Response:
The available letters from the given words are r, e, c, k (from FRECK with correct positions of r, e, c, k). Since the feedback from CRANE has 'r' and 'c' marked as correct, they are already correct. No other letters seem to align perfectly.

The current letters we have to work with are: r, e, c, k with these positions confirmed. The incorrect letters in Cranes were A, N, E, F, which can be used for elimination.

Considering combinations with r, e, c, k, trying to create a new word with these placements:

- r___r would be invalid as r is already in the correct spot.
- e___r would not likely form a common English word.

Let we try the following:
- c_r_k
 - c_r_e_k
 - r_c_e_k
 - c_r_e_c

Some of these are not realistic as English words forms. </think>
