### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM → Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE → Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK → Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step by step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Let me solve this step by step.
<think> 
Answer:
DRONE 
Response:
1. From Guess 1 (CRANE):
   - C(x) means C is not in the word
   - R(✓) means R is in the word and in the correct position
   - A(x) means A is not in the word
   - N(✓) means N is in the word and in the correct position
   - E(✓) means E is in the word and in the correct position

2. From Guess 2 (BRINE):
   - B(x) means B is not in the word
   - r(✓) means r is in the word but not in the correct position (it’s already in the secondnd position from the CRAIN feedback)
   - I(x) means I is not in the word
   - N(✓) means N is in the word and in the correct position (consistent with CRane)
   - E(✓) means E is in the word and in the correct position

Combining these two pieces of information:
- The word must contain r, n, and e.
- It must not contain c, b, a, i.

3. Let's make an educated guess considering above rules and try for a new word that satisfies these constraints.

A plausible 5-letter word could be: "RaNne".

Let, I will make the guess.

Answer:
MANGA 
Response:
From Guess 1: CRaneE:
- C is at
 - R is
 - A, N, E are not in the word

From Guess 2: BANjoO:
 - B is
 - A (✓) - from both guesses
 - N (✓)
 - J is not in the word
 - O is not in the word

Considering the correct positions from the feedback:
- B is in the 1st position
 - A is in the 3rd position

The word must contain B and A in these positions. Let's try to include other letters that haven't been "x-ed" out, namely C, N, J, and O, and see a word that fits these criteria.

A new 5-letter guess might be:
<guess> BANJO </guess>
However, given that J and O are not in the word, and we need to avoid them.
 Let's try a different combination.

Response:
- From Guess 1 (CRANE):
  - C and R are not in the word (C(x) r(x)).
  - A is in the word but not in this position (A(-)).
  - N is not in the word (N(x)).

- From Guess 2 (ABOUT):
  - A is in the word but not in this position (A(-)).
  - B is in the word but in this position (B(✓)).
  - O and U are not in the word (O(x) U(x)).
  - T is not in the word (T(x)).

- Considering both guesses, we can determine:
  - B is in the word and in the second position (B(✓)).
  - A is in the word, but we know it is not in the first or last position.
  - C, R, n, o, u, and t are not in the word.
  - The word excludes the letters "c", "r", "n", "o", "u", and "t".
  - We need to include "a" and find the right positions for the other letters.

Let the potential word candidates:
  - Starting with B, we can try words "BASTE", which includes:
    - "B" is fixed in the second position.
    - "A" is not in the first and last.
    - We still need to fit "S", "T", and "E" consistently with the rules. </think>

Answer:
FRAIL 
Response:
- From Guess 1 (CRANE), we know:
  - Neither 'C' nor 'E' are in the word.
  - 'R' and 'A' are in the correct positions.
- From Guess 2 (BRASH), we know:
  - Neither 'B', 'S', 'H' are in the word, which is has to be the correct information since they appear with 'x'.
  - 'R' and 'A' are confirmed from the previous guess and must be correct.
  - 'R' and 'A' are in the correct positions again, confirming the positions from Guess 1.

Given this feedback, the word now should include 'R' and 'A' in the second and fourth positions, respectively. 

So the word structure is starting to take shape as _RA_R_.

I now need to consider the letters that are not present: B, S, H, C, E.
Looking at the remaining letters I have not seen in the 2 guesses:
- N, D, I, M, L, T, V, W, X, Y, Z 

Since we have confirmed letters in their positions, let's try to fill the remaining possible letters.

Let the next logical word to consider could potentially be "RANCE". Let's verify.

Answer:
PERCH 
Response:
From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C is not in the word
- R is not in the word
- A is in the word, but in the wrong position
- N is not in the word
- E is not in the word

From Guess 2 (RELIC):
- R is in the word, but in the wrong position
 - E is in the word, in the correct position (given by the positive feedback)
 - L is not in the word
 - I is not in the word
 - C is not in the word

Combining these pieces of information, we can infer:
- E must be in the 2nd position (from Guess 2)
 - C, N, and E cannot be in the word
 - A must be somewhere else, not the 3rd position
 - R, L, and I cannot be in the word

So the word must contain: R, e, and one of the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Let I will take a calculated guess as per this information.

Answer:

Response:
From Guess 1: CRaneE:
- C is at the word but in the wrong position.
- R and A are not in the word.
 - N and E are not in the word.

From Guess 2: REbutT:
 - r is the word and in the correct position.
 - E is not in the word.
 - B and U are not in the word.
 - T is the word and in the correct position.

This gives us the following information:
1. The word contains "r" and "t".
2. The word does not contain "a", "b", "c", "e", "n", "u", "e", and "s".
3. "r" is in the first position.
4. "t" is in the last position.

So, we have _r_ _t_. The remaining letters (2nd and 3rd) are unknown but cannot be a, b, b, c, e, n, s, b, or u.

- W is in the word but not in these positions (-W)
- E and A are not in the word (-E, -A)
- T is not in the word (T(x))

Based on this, we can already place S in the first position. We also know A and E are not in the word. We know W is also not, so we can't use those letters.

Let think of some letters that are not yet tested and decide on a word.
 - K

Answer:
REARM 
Response:
- Analyzing the feedback from the first guess (CRANE):
  - C is NOT in the word
  - R is in the WRONG position
  - A is in the 3rd position
  - N is NOT in the word
  - E is NOT in the word

- Analyzing the feedback from the second guess (PEARL):
  - P is in the WRONG position
  - E is in the 2nd position (it's correct)
  - A is in the 3rd position (it's correct, same as CRane)
  - R is in the 2nd position (it's correct, same as CrAne)
  - L is NOT in the word

From this, we can set up our word with known correct positions:
- The 2nd position: E
- The 3rd position: A

With these letter placements, I need to incorporate:
- No P
 - No C, N, E (based on CRane)
 - No L (based on PEAR)

Let letters to avoid are: C, L, N, P, E. Based on the letters used (A, R, r, p), and knowing the above constraints, we can test with a few options.

Let my tentative guess is: RAAPER in order to test further.

Response:
### Analyzing the previous guesses and feedback:

1. **Guess 1: CRaneE**
   - C(-) r(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
     - This means:
       - 'C' is not in the word.
       - 'r' is in the word but in the wrong position.
       - 'A', 'N', and 'E' are not in the word.

2. **Guess 2: MuSiC**
   - M(x) U(x) S(x) I(-) C(-)
     - This means:
       - 'M', 'U', and 'S' are not in the word.
       - 'I' is is in the word but in the wrong position.
       - 'C' is is in the word but in the wrong position (confirmed from the first guess).

### Considering the above information:
   - 'C' and 'r' are in the word, 'r' in the wrong position.
   - 'A', 'N', 'M', 'U', 'N', 'N', and 'E' are not in the word.
   - 'S' and 'I' are not in the correct position and 'C' is is in the word.

### To find a new 5-letter word, keep in mind:
   - The word should not have 'A', 'M', 'U', 'S', 'I', 'C', 'r', 'E'.
   - 'S' and 'I' can only be in the wrong position.
   - 'C' must be somewhere in the word.

 - E is in the first position (✓).
 - M is is NOT in the word.
 - I is is NOT in the word.
 - T is is NOT in the word.

Given the positions, we can fill in:
- The second letter is r.
- The first letter is e.

This leaves us with the positions 3, 4, and 5 to figure out. We can use the knowledge that:
- C, A, N, E, M, I, T are invalid.
 - The word is 5 letters and needs of the above characters, r and e are already placed.

Let I try a word that fits these criteria and doesn't contain any of the invalid characters: e.g., "readi".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

 Here is some previous feedback:

Answer:
THIEF 
Response:
From Guess 1 (CRANE), we know:
- C, R, a, n, and e are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (SMELT), we know:
- S and m are in the word but not in those positions.
- e, L, and t are not in the word.

Given these letters are not in the word, let's work through the remaining possibilities:

Considering the hints from smelt and that some letters are missing from the word:
- S, m, e, l, t, and a cannot be in the word.
The remaining letters are: c, n, n, r, n, and e.

Start constructing a guess considering the known feedback, avoiding letters that are marked as incorrect and not including the repeated consonants from trick settings.

A good word to guess next might include:
1. S (already determined incorrect)
2. M (already determined incorrect)
3. E (already determined incorrect)

Let I'll test a new word omitting these.

Answer:
CRACK 
Response:
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
1. From "CRANE":
   - C is in position 1 (✓)
   - R in position 2 (✓)
   - A in position 3 (✓)
   - N and E are not in the word.

2. From "CRASH":
   - C is in position 1 (✓)
   - r in position 2 (✓)
   - A in position 3 (✓)
   - S is in the word but in the wrong position
   - H is in the word but in the wrong position

From the information above, we can conclude:
- C is in position 1
 - r in position 2
 - A in position 3
 - Neither S nor H can be in their respective positions (4 or 5)

Let the remaining letters for positions 4 and 5 must be something other than S and H, and they should not repeat C, r, or A. 

Let position 4 and 5, we can use letters like K, D, L, M, P, etc. Since we don't have any other specific constraints, let's make a reasonable guess.

I will try the word "CRADL" as it follows the constraints and uses different letters.

Answer:
SMOTE 
Response:
1. From the feedback on "CRANE":
   - C, R, a, n are incorrect.
   - E is in the word, but in the wrong position. So, E cannot be in the 5th position.

2. From the feedback on "HOUSE":
   - H and U are incorrect.
   - E is in the word and in the 5th position.

Given these constraints, we know E must be in the 5th position and cannot be in the other letters. Let's consider the remaining letters and positions:

- The possible letters from CRane: are C, R, a, n, which are wrong.
 - The possible letters from HOuse are H, o, u, which are wrong.

Given this, the new word guess needs to be composed of letters that have not been used incorrectly yet and fit the criteria.

Answer:
SCOUR 
Response:
1. From Guess 1 (CRANE):
   - C(-) means C is not in the word.
   - r(-) means r is not in the word.
   - A(x) means A is is not in the word, but it could be in the 3rd position.
   - N(x) and E(x) means N and E are not in the word.
   
2. From Guess 2 (ROCKY):
   - r(-) means R is not in the word.
   - O(-) means O is is not in the word.
   - C(-) confirms C is is not in the word.
   - K(x) means K is in the word.
   - Y(x) means Y is is not in the word.
   
 With this information, we can derive the following:
- C, R, and N are not in the word.
 - A is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.
 - Y is is not in the word.
 - O is is not in the word.
 - K is in the word.
 
 This leaves the letters B, D, G, H, I, J, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z for the word.
 
 Considering the feedback and the knowledge that K is in the word, we should include K in our next guess and test potential positions for K and other letters.
 
 A suitable next guess taking all this into account can be:

Answer:
FRILL 
Response:
1. From Guess 1 (CRANE):
   - C is not in the word
   - R is in the correct position, so R must be in the 2nd position
   - A is not in the word
   - N is not in the word
   - E is not in the word

2. From Guess 2 (FROST):
   - F is in the correct position, so f is in the 1st position
   - R is in the correct position, so it matches the previous guess 
   - O not in the word
   - S not in the word
   - T is not in the word

By combining both pieces of information, we can verify:
- The 1st and 2nd positions are F and R respectively.
 - Neither O, S, nor T can be correct as they were not found or they were in wrong positions.

Now, both O and S cannot be correct leaving B, I, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z as possible candidates for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th positions.
Let I will make an educated guess by filling in the remaining positions with common letters.

Answer:
DEBAR 
Response:
From Guess 1 (CRANE), we have:
- C is not in the word
 - A is not in the word
 - N is not in the word
 - E is not in the word

From Guess 2 (TAPER), we have:
- T is in the word
 - A is not in the word (consistent)
 - P is not in the word
 - E is not in the word (consistent)
 - R is in the word (so R must be at position 5)

With this information, let's eliminate C, A, N, and E from the word. Also, since r is in the word, it can't be in position 5 (as we already know that). 

Some possible letters now are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Taking all these into account, the only place we have uncertainty is in the first position. Let's guess a word to cover the possibilities while ensuring the letter r is in the right place (position 5).

A possible word to guess next is DASHV.

1. From the feedback "craneen" -> C(x), r(-), A(x), N(x), E(-), we know that 'r' is in the word but not in position 2, 'a' and 'n' are not in the word at all, and neither are 'c' and 'e'.
2. We need to make a guess that doesn't contain 'a', 'n', 'c', 'e', and doesn't have 'r' in the second position.
3. Considering common 5-letter words structures, I'll go with a guess that has a mix of consonants and vowels, and avoids these specific letters.

Based on this reasoning, I'll start with a guess that includes these

The previous guess was CRaneE and it resulted in all 'x', which means none of the letters are correct in any position. This gives us the following information:
- C, R,a,n,e are not in the secret word.
Since we need a new 5-letter word, we can consider a word that doesn't include these letters. Also, we should try to incorporate new letters that can fit the 5-letter pattern. A good starting point could be a word with a common vowel like 'a' or 'i', as these are often present in wordsle.

Let me solve this step by step.
<think> 
Answer:
BEFIT 
Response:
1. Analyzing the feedback for guess 1 (CRANE):
   - C, R, a, n, and e are all marked as x (not in the word).
2. This significantly narrows down the possible letters for the secret word.

Next, I will make a new guess, avoiding the letters that are confirmed not to be in the word, and trying to place the remaining letters in potential positions.

You are playing Wordle, a word-guessing game.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM → Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE → Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK → Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step by step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Let me solve this step by step.
<think> 
Answer:
SHELF 
Response:
From Guess 1 (CRANE):
- C, R, a, n, e are all marked as x (not in the word).

From Guess 2 (SMELT):
- S and L are marked as ✓ (correct letter, correct position).
 - M, E, and T are marked as - (not in the word).

Given these clues:
- The word must contain 'S' and 'L'.
 - 'M', 'E', and 'T' are not used.
 - The letters 'C', 'R', 'A', 'N', and 'N' are also excluded.
 - Therefore, we need to find a word with 'S' and 'L' that doesn't include 'M', 'E', and 'T'.

Potential words candidates could be "SAILS", "SILLS", "SMILE", "SLAMS", etc. Let's try to eliminate candidates:
- TRY SAILS:
  Guess 1 (CRANE) clears out several vowels, so A, I, and E won't be correct.
  Covers 'S' and 'L', but 'L' might be in a wrong position.
  
Guess SAILS.

 Here is some previous feedback:

Let me solve this step by step.
<think> 
Answer:
SMITH 
Response:
From the first guess (CRANE), we know:
C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

From the second guess (GHOST), we know:
G and O are not in the word.
H is is in the word, but it's not in the first or last position (ne represents it's in the word but in the wrong position).

Given these constraints, let's try a new 5-letter word that avoids the wrong letters and includes H as a middle letter (since it must be in the word but not at the ends).

I'll try: SEARCH.

Let me solve this step by step.
<think> 
Answer:
CHAOS 
Response:
1. Analyzing the first guess "CRANE":
   - C is in the 1st position (✓)
   - r is not in the word (x)
   - A is in the 3rd position (✓)
   - N is not in the word (x)
   - E is not in the word (x)

2. Analyzing the second guess "COAST":
   - C (1st position) is present (✓)
   - O is not present (-)
   - A (3rd position) is present (✓)
   - S is not present (-)
   - T is not present (-)

Given the feedback, we learn:
- Both 'C' and 'A' are in the correct positions.
- 'O', 'S', 'N' are not in the word.

Considering the positions and letters:
- 1st position is C
- 3rd position is A
- 2nd and 4th must be a different combination

I will try a new word considering C and A are correct and evaluating positions for the other letters.
