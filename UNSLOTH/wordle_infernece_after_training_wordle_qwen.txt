Sample #1
Secret word: ABHOR

Model output:
1. Since we have no initial feedback, we should start with a common 5-letter word that has a mix of vowels and consonants to gather more information about the word.
2. A good starting word could be "CRANE" as it contains a mix of vowels and consonants and includes some common letters.

Sample #4
Secret word: ANNUL
Guess 1: LANES
Model output:
1. Analyze the feedback from the first guess "CRANE":
   - C, R, e are not in the word (x)
   - A and N are not in the correct positions (-)

2. Consider possible words patterns based on the given information:
   - The word does not contain C, r, or e.
   - It contains A and N but not in the positions they were in CRane.

3. Generate a new 5-letter word that avoids the excluded letters and includes the ones with incorrect positions.
