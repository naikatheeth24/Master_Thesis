    "You are playing Wordle, a word-guessing game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Rules:\n",
    "- You have 6 tries to guess a secret 5-letter English word.\n",
    "- After each guess, you will receive feedback on each letter using these symbols:\n",
    "  ✓ : The letter IS IN THE WORD and in the CORRECT position.\n",
    "  - : The letter is IN THE WORD but in the WRONG position.\n",
    "  x : The letter is NOT in the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Output Format:\n",
    "YOU **MUST** respond **only** in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "<think>\n",
    "Step-by-step logical reasoning based on the feedback from previous guesses.\n",
    "</think>\n",
    "<guess>\n",
    "your-5-letter-word\n",
    "</guess>\n",
    "\n",
    "**CRUCIAL:**  \n",
    "- The <guess> tag MUST come AFTER the CLOSED </think> tag.Any response where <guess> appears before </think> is invalid and will be discarded.   \n",
    "- You **MUST** include the `<guess>` tag after the reasoning, with your guessed word inside.  \n",
    "- DO NOT write anything outside these tags.  \n",
    "- Your guessed word must be exactly 5 letters, lowercase, and consistent with the feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of the expected response format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous Feedback:\n",
    "Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)  \n",

    "1. From Guess 1, C is correct in position 1, A is correct in position 3.\n",
    "2. R, N, E are not in the word at all.\n",
    "3. From Guess 2, O and S are in the word, but not in positions 2 or 4.\n",
    "4. T is not in the word.\n",
    "5. So the word must have C at position 1, A at position 3, O and S somewhere (not positions 2 and 4), and cannot include R, N, E, or T.\n",

    "</think>\n",
    "<guess>\n",
    "coals\n",
