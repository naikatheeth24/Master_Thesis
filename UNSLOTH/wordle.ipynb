The subsequent guess, \"CURLY,\"  provided a \"C\" (correct) again, confirming that the first letter is indeed correct.  However, it also showed \"U\" (incorrect) and \"R\" (incorrect), suggesting that the second and third letters are not part of the solution. Furthermore, \"L\" and \"Y\" were also incorrect.  Therefore, we need to revise our strategy.  Since \"C\" is correct, let's retain it. We also need to eliminate \"U\", \"R\", \"L\", and \"Y\".
